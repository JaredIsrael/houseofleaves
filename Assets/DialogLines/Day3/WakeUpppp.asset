  - Ughhhh... my heads not any better...
  - Did I sleep through the night?
  - I'm not... sure??

  - Keys? Did they mean there's one to Mom's room?
  - I can't think of any other locks worth a damn.
  - ...but who would have hidden a key around? Mom?
  - Maybe she left a spare lying around somewhere.
  - ...
  - It's hard to even think about going in there.

  - No way to bring her home...
