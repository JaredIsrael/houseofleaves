  - What a weird dream.
  - I remember Mom teaching me that song years ago.
  - After Dad died, she moved that old piano into the basement.
  - After a while, I started to forget it was there. It felt like she did too.
  - ...
  - My head's killing me. I need more sleep.
  - I should get some stuff done first though.
