  - Ahhh the kitchen. Sort of rustic, like the rest of the house.
  - I'd say standing in here would make me hungry, but I'm already starving X_X
  - I should get cooking!
  - '[Approach the cutting board near the sink and press ''F'' to cut veggies. Click
    to slice when the marked part of the veggie passes under the knife! You only
    have one pass at each one!]'
